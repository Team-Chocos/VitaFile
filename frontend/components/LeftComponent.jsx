  *Patient Information*
  - Name: Mr. SHORYA DWIVEDI
  - Age/Sex: 16 years/Male
  - Referred By: Dr. Aviral Shailesh (D.M.Pulmonary Medicine)
  - Mobile: 6263808020
  - Organization: Sodani Diagnostic (Vijay Nagar)
  
  *Test Description*
  - Test: Serum TSH
  - Value: 2.04 uIU/mL
  - Unit: uIU/mL
  - Reference Range: 0.35 - 5.5
  - Method: Atelica/Chemiluminescence
  
  *Interpretation & Limitation*
  - Elevated levels of T3 & T4 suppress the production of TSH via negative feedback mechanism. In primary hypothyroidism, T3 & T4 levels are low and TSH levels are elevated. Primary hyperthyroidism (Grave’s disease, thyroid adenoma, nodular goiter) is associated with high levels of thyroid hormones and depressed or undetectable TSH.
  - The result should be used in conjunction with clinical impression and results of other thyroid tests.
  - Isolated high TSH especially in the range of 5 to 15 uIU/ml is commonly associated with physiological and biological variability and in recovery phase after non thyroid illness.
  - Isolated Low TSH – especially in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 often seen in elderly & associated with Non – Thyoidal illness.Performance of this assay has not been established with neonates.
  - Specimens from the patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies may contain human anti mouse antibody (HAMA), such specimen may show falsely elevated or depressed results.Reference range source: Guidelines of American Thyroid Association during Pregnancy and postpartum,2011.
  - TSH is said to show a diurnal variation with a peak after midnight and nadir in the late afternoon. The variation in TSH is such that the peak value can be double the value at the nadir. The values of TSH can vary to 20% in between measurements without any changes in the thyroid status
  
  *Associated Test*
  - Free T3 (Triiodothyronine) and Free T4 (Thyroxine) Tests: These tests measure the actual levels of thyroid hormones circulating in the blood and are often used in conjunction with TSH to assess thyroid function more comprehensively.
